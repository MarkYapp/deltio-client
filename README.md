# Deltio

### Create, collect, and share beautiful digital postcards.

##### Live demo: [https://powerful-brook-49143.herokuapp.com](https://powerful-brook-49143.herokuapp.com)

#### Summary:

Deltio takes inspiration from Deltiologyâ€”the study and collection of postcards. With Deltio, users can create an account, log in, and start designing their own collection. They can save, edit, and delete their postcards, and share them via email.

The postcard design process is at the heart of Deltio. For the front of the card, users find an image drawing from the works of talented photographers via the Unsplash API. For the back of the postcards, users see their message appear on the card as they type it.

#### Future version concepts:

- Users can connect with each other, and share postcards directly without email
- A Community page showcases postcards users choose to make public
- Users can select from multiple images in a viewbox
- Users can upload their own image
- Users can select the postcard message font
